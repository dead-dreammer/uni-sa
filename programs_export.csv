2021 Bachelor of Science Honours in Information Technology
Senior Business Intelligence Developer at Massmart Head Office
My journey with Richfield Technology has been exciting and challenging in the best way possible. I had the
opportunity to work with Dr Stephen Akandwanaho as my supervisor and he really did push my limits to
bring out the best in me. The values he instilled in me, I carry with me daily into my job, my personal life and
especially my ambitions.
The opportunity arose for a Senior BI Developer position at Massmart and going through my accolades,
my honours with Richfield Technology did carry alot of weight in me obtaining the role.
We work with data daily and our main purpose is to manage a transitionary server. We gain access to alot
of tools that make our jobs alot easier. Alteryx is one of the tools that we use to assist us in creating all the
elements required for a database and it’s objects. Previously in SSMS we would create each table manually
for each database and what could take employees 1 week to do, we can now do in 5 minutes. So efficiency is
what you can gain if you have the right tools and you have the knowledge to use those tools.
Richfield exposes one to many new tools and the coursework keeps you excited especially about advanced
software engineering, analytics and research. I was exposed to IBM and AWS cloud while at Richfield and
my level of content has increased greatly.

My experience studying with Richfield was life-changing. The ease with which I could interact with the
administrative staff at Richfield, as well as my supervisor, Dr. Stephen Akandwanaho, made the studies so
much more easier, taking into consideration that I studied online. Dr. Stephen was always available, even
in the middle of the night, for assistance and guidance on any matter. I recall e-mail correspondence and
telephone calls way after midnight between Dr. Stephen and I while I was busy with my dissertation. The
display of such unselfish acts show that Richfield will go beyond their call of duty to be of service to their
students, something that I can truly commend.
Richfield employs dynamic and inter-active learning/teaching methods for all its students. The knowledge
gained while studying with Richfield will stand anyone in good stead for the current industry needs of
cutting-edge technology, disruptive innovation, critical thinking and effective communication. Studying with
Richfield, you will gain all of that as they partner with industry leaders such Amazon Web Services (AWS),
CIMA, IBM, Oracle and many others. l encourage any prospective student to study with Richfield as the
experience will allow you to rise above the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment that
our country is currently facing.
