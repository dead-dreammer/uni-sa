Okay, so I just wanted to say that, uh, I was too stressed at least to tell you about the CAKE. I genuinely thought I told you when I gave you the lunch box😭
So the reason I didn't tell you earlier was that I actually was fasting, and I felt bad, so I froze the cake until fasting was over (which was in 4 days). 
It was SO GOOD. Are you kidding me? I ate all of it in one go😭. Thank you so so much for allowing me to taste your creations, jaan💗
2024/11/20, 01:11 - Alex 🪐: HII MY LOVE 
I tried to wait for you after we wrote but I had to leave.

please don't sweat it at all 🫶 well I'm glad you like it and also please next time let me know, there's no reason for you too feel bad ✨

also it's the least I could do, I hope you're studying hard 🫵 I will see you on Tuesday ❤️

2.	Focus on Alan Turing and the Turing test. What is it and what are the success metrics. 
3.	Be able to describe and define the different types of AI systems, Robots etc. 
4.	Know the AI system Diagram. Sensors, Actuators etc. 
5.	Know the PEAS framework and be able to define and environment and an expert system using this. 
6.	Know the in’s and out’s of an Expert system. Be able to define describe and give an example of a percept sequence, a knowledge base, inference engine, explanation module etc. 
7.	Be able to come up with predicates or use predicates. 
8.	Truth tables and how those along with predicates form our rules in our rules engine. 
9.	Remember the Binary trees that we did in class, Depth First Search and Breadth First Search. 
10.	Lastly, prologs. How do we take a scenario and turn that scenario into predicates and axioms. 
11.	And lastly, EVERYTHING we did in class and EVERYTHING covered by the assignment. 
12.	Use that assignment also as a point of reference and make sure you are able to implement that in a test setting.

2025/08/14, 21:03 - Alex 🪐: for yours, there's alot of table so there's also alot of space when putting each table on a new page. I'm wonder if we can maybe get some conclusions to fill in the white gaps
2025/08/14, 21:03 - Alex 🪐: but it's not for all, just some
2025/08/14, 21:19 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: Okay no problem, send them to me

2025/08/14, 21:44 - Alex 🪐: page 22, 23 and 24
2025/08/14, 21:49 - Alex 🪐: hey teewee are you available for a call ?
2025/08/14, 21:50 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: Will get on it in a little bit

2025/08/14, 21:55 - Alex 🪐: <Media omitted>
2025/08/14, 22:29 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: Okay. So 3.6 highlights in detail (as it says that it should be an analysis) about the what Uni.sa should do on the website. It includes everything that we want on the website, why we need it, and the success criteria is just an estimation of how well that feature is going to do on the site with regards with our users
2025/08/14, 22:29 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: Although I can remove it
2025/08/14, 22:30 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: The success criteria i mean, its just that when it says analysis, i understood that as including estimations of how well and therefore how relevant that feature would be
2025/08/14, 22:31 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: And i didn't really change 3.7 because I mean, they didn't ask for an analysis just a basic overview of certain requirements the website should have
2025/08/14, 22:33 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: I can maybe remove success criteria and priority
2025/08/14, 22:37 - Thwisha Mothilall (Twi) BSC: Also I'll make a conclusion for each table. 2 sentences should be okay?
