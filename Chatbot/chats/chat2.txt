2025/05/01, 18:02 - M. Narainsamy BSC Y2: Agile’s flexibility is a great fit for our platform because key features like university matching, AI chatbots, scholarship finders, and personalized course recommendations need to adapt continuously. As student needs and ideas evolve, Agile allows our team to update and improve the system quickly.

Our platform can be developed and released in stages, with working features delivered one after the other. For example, the student profile and matching engine can be launched first, followed by the scholarship finder, comparison tool, and other key components. This keeps development focused and progress visible.

User feedback is central to how our platform evolves. Agile supports this through regular iterations, allowing our team to make improvements based on what students and advisors actually need and experience when using the system.

Since our platform uses advanced technologies like the Google Maps API and AI chatbots, there are technical risks involved. Agile helps manage this by encouraging early testing, so problems can be identified and solved before they become bigger issues later on.

Agile also improves teamwork across the development process. It helps frontend and backend developers, mobile app creators, database designers, and testers work closely together even when using different tools or technologies. This leads to better integration and smoother delivery.
2025/05/01, 18:07 - Alex 🪐: Agile's flexibility is well-suited for the project, as it supports continuous adaptation of features such as university matching, AI chatbots, scholarship finders, and recommendation systems based on user feedback and emerging ideas.

Agile enables the release of functional components in stages, allowing developers to prioritize core features like the matching engine first, followed by the scholarship finder and other modules, ensuring steady progress and early value delivery.

Using a User-Centered Development (UCD) approach ensures the platform evolves with input from real users, including students and advisors. Agile facilitates this through frequent iterations that incorporate feedback into each development cycle.

The integration of technologies like Google Maps API and AI chatbots introduces risks, but Agile mitigates these through early testing and continuous evaluation, allowing potential issues to be addressed proactively.

Agile fosters strong collaboration across the development team, helping frontend and backend developers, database designers, and testers to synchronize efforts effectively, even when working with different technologies.

2025/06/05, 21:59 - M. Narainsamy BSC Y2: The UNI-SA project is more than just a technical solution—it's a meaningful step toward helping South African high school students make informed decisions about their future. By focusing on accessibility, personalization, and ease of use, the platform aims to simplify the often overwhelming process of choosing a university, finding scholarships, and meeting application deadlines.

With clear objectives, a realistic timeline, and a dedicated team using reliable tools and methods, the project is on track to deliver a fully functional system by the end of July 2025. Every element—from the user-friendly interface and AI chatbot to the admin dashboard and visualization tools has been thoughtfully planned to meet the real needs of students and educational stakeholders.

By the final submission date in October, UNI-SA will stand as a well-tested, locally run application that not only showcases strong technical development but also delivers real value to its users. With continued collaboration, careful planning, and a shared commitment to quality, this project has the potential to make a lasting difference in the way students approach higher education in South Africa

2025/06/05, 22:18 - M. Narainsamy BSC Y2: From our research, we have seen that there is a real gap in how South African students apply to tertiary institutions, especially in under-resourced schools. Many students don’t have access to proper guidance or digital tools, and platforms like CAO, GoStudy, and EduConnect only offer limited support they don’t provide smart recommendations, real-time matching, or a fully integrated experience. Because of this, students often miss deadlines, feel overwhelmed, or end up choosing courses that don’t suit them. To better understand these challenges, we will be conducting interviews and surveys with students, teachers, and university staff between August and September 2025. The insights we gain will help shape UNI-SA a user-focused website designed to simplify the application process with features like program matching based on academic results, scholarship filters, and deadline reminders. Later on, we plan to expand it into a mobile app for even more accessibility. While we know there are challenges ahead like ensuring accurate data, minimizing user input errors, and addressing unequal access to technology we are confident in our approach. With a solid tech stack (Flask, React, SQL Server), agile project management, and a clear roadmap, we believe UNI-SA is a practical and scalable solution that can truly support students on their higher education journey <This message was edited>

2025/06/10, 12:55 - M. Narainsamy BSC Y2: Ooooo bru i thought we went over 40 pages
2025/06/10, 13:00 - Alex 🪐: no I'm concerned about the fact that noone has throughly checked our 36 pages of theory which makes up 90% of the documentation
